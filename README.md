### Programming Problem Notes
  For each programming problem, let us know:
  Passes test as given by the driver.
  How we should compile your code (g++ command or make target) type make to compile my program.
  
  - Compile using the make given by Codio. 
  
  Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation
  
  - Initially started a process of multiple helper functions ended by using one and implement several into the main code.
  
  Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in
  
  - No additional tests were wrote.
  
  Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests, knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit) errors in mydatastore.cpp causing amazon.cpp not to run correctly.
  
 -  No known errors within the code.
